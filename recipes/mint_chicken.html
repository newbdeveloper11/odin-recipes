        <ol>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic.
                
            </li>
            <li>Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</li>
            <li>
                Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
            </li>
            <li>Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned</li>
            <li>
                Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through.
                <br>Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.
